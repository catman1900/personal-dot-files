===== Binet and Simon invent a school abilities test =====
- 4 things made their test different from an iq test

	2.They wanted the tests to just show who needed help, not to just catagorize them as smart or dumb
	3. they made it clear that training and oppertunity could affect intelligence
	4. They made the test //empirically //so it wasn't trying to test a particular theory of intelligencent
